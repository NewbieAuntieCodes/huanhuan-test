                3. How gifted children should develop their strengths and overcome any weaknesses.

                Please brainstorm and provide a concise list of ideas for these discussion points in bullet points.
                The ideas should be practical and suitable for a DSE-level discussion.

        <h3>Understanding the input text</h3>
        <p>
          In the speaking exam, you will be given a short input text. It is
          important that you understand this text so that you will be able to
          talk about it.
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <strong>Main idea</strong> - usually appears at the beginning of the
            text or in the headline
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Details</strong> - can be found in the main body of the text
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Conclusion</strong> - the last part of the text which
            usually contains a summary of the topic, opinions or suggestions

          <h4>Parental involvement helps students succeed</h4>
          <p>
            Developing strong study habits at an early age is the key to
            academic success. It is no secret that many parents in Hong Kong
            encourage their children to spend more time on homework and enrol in
            tutorial classes. As a result, many of these students perform well
            at school.
          </p>
          <p>
            It is <strong>beneficial</strong> when parents play an active role
            in their children's studies. At home, parents can help their
            children with homework, or give them advice on understanding tricky
            concepts. Students who receive parental support may become more{" "}
            <strong>motivated</strong> to work through difficult assignments. In
            addition, they tend to be well behaved and able to concentrate on
            tasks for long periods of time.
          </p>
        </ArticleBox>
        <p>
          Identifying the main idea and conclusion in the input text will give
          you a good basis for starting the discussion. For example:
        </p>
        <ConversationBubble>
          <p>
            Hello everyone. Let's start our discussion. Our topic for today's
            discussion is whether parental involvement at school is good for
            children. What do you think?
          </p>
        </ConversationBubble>
        <p>
          The details in the input text can give you ideas for talking points.
          For example:
        </p>
        <ConversationBubble>
          <p>
            One advantage of parental involvement in education is that children
            start developing good learning habits at an early age.

        <h3>Note-taking skills: organizing your notes</h3>
        <p>
          You have ten minutes to prepare for the speaking exam. Good
          note-taking skills will help you make the best use of your time.
        </p>
        <Exercise>
          <Instruction>
            <strong>D2</strong> Chris and Amy have been making notes for the
            Exam practice question on page 13. In pairs, discuss who you think
            has better note-taking skills. Why?

              <p>What Oliver could do to deal with his problems:</p>
              <p>
                He can take a gap year to gain some life skills. He can attend
                some extra tutorial classes. He can also join a study group.
              </p>
              <p>What kind of support he needs:</p>
              <p>
                I think he needs more support from his parents, friends and
                tutors. They should perhaps talk to him and persuade him to
                develop better learning habits.
